```
Still light.
It’s stilly night.
I croon “DU-I-TO-DU”,
but has no sound.
So nothing I call your name.
Starlight.
It’s starry night.
Which is liberated, you or me?
I do nothing but call your name.
You’re free, it’s over love.
You’re free, and starting
another love game.
You’re free it’s over love.
Anyhow I’m alone again.
Clear white.
It’s Clearly white.
All I want to do was gone
darkness.
Its shadows cause me pain.
You’re free across the moon.
You’re free and going on so far
away.
You’re free, across the moon.
Anyone can never chain.
I’m in our history yet.
Seems like here is your smile.
How long will keep this way?
Don’t say “250,000miles”.
You’re free, it’s over love.
You’re free, and starting
another love game.
You’re free, it’s over love.
You’re free, and starting
another love game.
You’re free, it’s over love.
Anyhow, I’m alone again.
You’re free, across the moon.
You’re free across the moon.
You’re free and going on so far
away.
You’re free, across the moon.
Anyone can never chain.
Anyhow, I’m alone again.
